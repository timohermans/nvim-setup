# My neovim setup

So this is my neovim setup. Haven't given it much thought, so could be lots of stuff is wrong or unnecessary.

## Keep in mind

This is only for Windows. Haven't tested this on Linux, though will surely fail on lots of stuff, as paths are Windows specific paths!

## Other requirements

I've also installed the following:

- fzf (`scoop install fzf`)
- ripgrep (`scoop install ripgrep`)
